## Animu

Video streaming webapp for watching, sharing and managing
media in a local network. This app serves as a “Hello World” for
introducing myself to new technologies and as such is never made with
the intention of use in a production system. This is the second iteration
using a MEAN stack.

* Node.js/Express.js serves as the backend using NGINX to speed up the static assets
* Angular.js is the javascript framework used in the client.
* Mongodb is used as the database as a way of introducing myself to NoSQL
