Video streaming webapp for watching, sharing and managing
media in a local network. This app serves as a “Hello World” for
introducing myself to new technologies and as such is never made with
the intention of use in a production system. This is the second iteration
using a MEAN stack.

Node.js/Express.js serves the backend and Angular.js as the frontend.
Mongodb is used as the database as a way of introducing myself to NoSQL.
NGNIX serves all the static assets to speed the streaming up.
